and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Default Audio Selection:** Selects the first available audio track after probing each new source, while preserving restored sessions and explicit track choices. Resolves [#151](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/151).
- **Conversion Start Guidance:** Replaces the unexplained disabled Start button with a specific reason for each blocked state and opens the output-folder chooser when that is the missing step. Resolves [#161](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/161).
- **Linux Window Title:** Sets `Frame` as the native window title so X11 desktops and window-management tools no longer display a blank application name. Resolves [#168](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/168).
- **Preview Wheel Zoom:** Uses the standard wheel direction, with upward scrolling zooming in and downward scrolling zooming out. Resolves [#160](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/160).
- **Settings Persistence Diagnostics:** Reports the failing read or write operation and a home-directory-redacted path, and preserves the existing settings target when atomic replacement fails. Improves diagnostics for [#150](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/150).

## [0.33.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **M2T, MTS, and M2TS Workflows:** Added complete MPEG transport-stream import, preview, re-encode, mixed subtitle, and stream-copy workflows with explicit 188-byte M2T and 192-byte MTS/M2TS profiles; MPEG-2 Video, MP2, Opus-in-TS, AC-3, and Blu-ray PCM encoding; program/service metadata Preserve, Clean, and Replace modes; SRT/ASS/WebVTT burn-in; embedded DVB/teletext/ARIB/PGS handling; and selectable `.sup` PGS copy or standards-compliant DVB conversion without private-data subtitle fallbacks. Resolves [#111](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/111).
- **Selectable External Subtitles:** Added multi-file import for SRT, ASS, and WebVTT sidecars as switchable output tracks, with per-track language, title, default, and forced metadata. External tracks are persisted with file settings, validated before conversion, kept synchronized with trimmed exports, and encoded according to the MP4, MOV, MKV, or WebM subtitle contract without forcing source audio and video streams out of copy mode.

### Changed

- **Explicit Stream Selection:** Audio and embedded subtitle exports now map only tracks explicitly selected by the user; an empty selection produces no stream of that type instead of implicitly preserving every source track.
- **Virtualized File Queue:** Reused the Logs panel's uniform-list rendering and scrollbar for the workspace file queue, keeping large batches responsive while preserving row selection, actions, and accessibility.
- **Subtitle Settings Workflow:** Split the Subtitles tab into Selectable and Burn-in modes so only the relevant controls are shown. Selectable subtitles now combine imported sidecars with embedded source tracks, while burn-in import uses the same post-import file-row and removal pattern as selectable subtitles.
- **Audio and Subtitle Track Rows:** Reworked shared track rows so audio metadata uses a readable two-line layout with channels, language, track name, and bitrate grouped together, while subtitle rows remain compact and preserve the track index and codec when space is limited. Source track names now fall back to FFmpeg handler metadata when no title is available.

### Fixed

- **Track Selection Feedback:** Smoothed selected, unselected, hover, and selection-dot transitions and cleared pressed state before click handlers run, preventing track rows from retaining an incorrect brighter color until focus moved elsewhere or showing an unwanted intermediate pressed color.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **Light and Dark Themes:** Added a persistent manual Dark/Light appearance setting backed by semantic OKLCH palettes, immediate whole-interface updates, accessible keyboard-selectable controls, deterministic visual-fixture overrides, contrast validation, and CI guards against legacy or unapproved UI color literals. Dark remains the default for existing installations.
- **UI Scaling:** Added persistent 80–200% interface scale presets to the Appearance section in app settings, primary-modifier zoom shortcuts, and scalable controls and custom input metrics across every GPUI surface. Interface scaling remains independent from preview canvas zoom and native macOS window controls. Resolves [#52](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/52) and [#60](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/60).
- **Release Supply-Chain Verification:** Added signed-tag and green-CI release gates, immutable release handling, SHA-256 checksum manifests, CycloneDX SBOMs, GitHub build-provenance attestations, and protected offline Ed25519 update-manifest signing.
- **Repository Security Automation:** Added weekly Dependabot updates, CodeQL, dependency review, `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` checks, security-focused CODEOWNERS rules, checksum-pinned workflow tooling, least-privilege permissions, and credential-free repository checkouts.
- **Update Session Restoration:** Kept update downloads running alongside conversions, blocked installation until conversion workers settle, atomically saved the queue and per-file settings before updater handoff, and restored that workspace after restart. Resolves [#66](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/66).
- **Structured Issue Forms:** Added guided bug-report and feature-request forms covering environment, source media, reproduction steps, logs, workflow context, alternatives, and duplicate and Code of Conduct confirmations while keeping blank issues available. Resolves [#79](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/79).

### Changed

- **macOS DMG Presentation:** Replaced the default Finder disk-image layout with a deterministic Retina-ready installer window, branded background, optically positioned application and Applications-folder icons, hidden Finder chrome, and checksum-pinned `dmgbuild` packaging in validation and release workflows.
- **Rust Dependency Stack:** Updated the application and release tooling to `cpal` 0.18, `ed25519-dalek` 3, `rfd` 0.17, `ureq` 3, `zip` 8, and newer vendored GPUI dependencies while preserving audio preview, signed-update, native dialog, verified download, and cross-platform bundling behavior.
- **Interface Motion:** Standardized GPUI transitions on shared surface and interaction timings with ease-in-out easing, and animated the Logs copy confirmation by scaling, blurring, and cross-fading between the copy and check icons.
- **Contributor CI Coverage:** Extended `cargo xtask ci` to format, test, and lint `frame-updater` explicitly, including its unit tests and all-target Clippy checks. Resolves [#72](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/72).
- **macOS Contributor Setup:** Documented the full-Xcode Metal Toolchain requirement, availability check, and component download command for GPUI shader builds. Resolves [#75](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/75).

### Fixed

- **Linux Titlebar Dragging:** Replaced GPUI-CE's immediate mouse-down window move with Zed's titlebar drag sequence, starting native X11 and Wayland moves only after pointer motion and isolating window controls from drag events. This prevents clicks on empty titlebar space from crashing affected Linux sessions. Resolves [#63](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/63) and [#110](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/110).
- **Updater Package Size Validation:** Enforced the signed manifest size before and during package downloads, revalidated cached packages, and removed rejected partial files so oversized or truncated update payloads are never installed or retained. Resolves [#83](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/83).
- **Rounded Timecode Boundaries:** Carried millisecond rounding across second, minute, and hour boundaries so values just below a boundary, such as `59.9999` seconds, render as `00:01:00.000` instead of producing an invalid timecode.
- **Timecode Trim Editing:** Reworked preview in/out fields as fixed `HH:MM:SS.mmm` masks with separator-skipping cursor navigation, draft-only editing, formatted paste support, Escape cancellation, and silent normalization and clamping only on Enter or focus loss, preventing partial input from being recalculated prematurely. Resolves [#74](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/74).
- **Pressed Button Foregrounds:** Kept animated text and icon colors synchronized with pressed button backgrounds across shared controls while the pointer moves, including correct hover restoration when released inside and animation reset when released outside.
- **Collision-Safe Output Paths:** Assigned deterministic suffixes to duplicate or existing output paths before conversion and disabled FFmpeg overwrites, preventing same-stem batch jobs or pre-existing targets from replacing prior data. Resolves [#81](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/81).
- **Display-Matrix Previews:** Applied source display-matrix orientation when sizing preview frames so portrait iPhone videos are no longer stretched to their encoded landscape dimensions.
- **Probe-Aware Stream Mapping:** Replaced wildcard audio and subtitle mapping with explicit `ffprobe` stream indices, ignored undecodable APAC and data tracks, and skipped bitmap subtitles when the target requires text subtitles. Explicit incompatible subtitle selections now fail during preflight. Resolves [#47](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/47) and [#68](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/68).
- **Conversion Notification Grammar:** Pluralized `file` and `error` independently so conversion-finished notifications use correct singular, plural, and zero-count wording. Resolves [#77](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/77).
- **Rust 1.95 Contributor Checks:** Restored `cargo xtask ci` on the pinned Rust 1.95 toolchain by resolving new Clippy diagnostics without changing application behavior or generated workflow output. Resolves [#70](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/70).

## [0.31.1] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- **Linux Notifications:** Routed conversion completion notifications through the XDG Desktop Portal with a direct notification-service fallback for non-Flatpak Linux installations, and removed the Flatpak permission for direct notification bus access.
- **Flathub Desktop Metadata:** Shipped ready-to-install desktop and AppStream metadata from upstream, moved the system media-tools environment flag into the Flatpak sandbox configuration, and removed build-time metadata rewriting and the launcher wrapper from the production manifest.

### Fixed

- **Windows Release Builds:** Pinned the Windows FFmpeg bundle to a retained BtbN month-end snapshot so release builds do not depend on daily assets that expire after 14 days.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **Updateable AppImage Releases:** Embedded `gh-releases-zsync` update information into Linux AppImage builds, generated matching `.zsync` metadata, and published those files with releases so AppImage managers can update Frame without manual GitHub downloads.
- **Production Flathub Distribution:** Added Flathub-ready manifest generation, release source and `cargo vendor` archives, automated Flathub repository PR updates, and a Flatpak runtime mode that uses Freedesktop-provided FFmpeg/FFprobe instead of bundled media binaries.
- **Media Filter Tabs:** Added dedicated Video Filters and Audio Filters settings tabs with FFmpeg-backed color, tone, detail, cleanup, style, interlace, volume, dynamics, EQ, pass, noise-reduction, de-essing, stereo-width, normalization, and limiter controls, including runtime filter capability detection, preview refresh handling, reset controls, and export/preview filter-chain coverage.
- **Settings Tab Tooltips:** Added animated labels to the icon-only settings tabs, with a configurable hover delay and a grace period for immediate transitions between neighboring tabs. Resolves [#45](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/57).
- **Reusable Conversion Sources:** Added explicit Cancel controls that stop queued, running, or paused conversions without removing their source, plus a Convert Again action that preserves completed-file settings and returns the source to an editable state. Resolves [#45](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/45).

### Changed

- **Output Folder Selection:** Conversion outputs now use the default output folder selected in Settings instead of being saved next to each source file, giving queued files from different locations one consistent destination.

### Fixed

- **UNC Output Paths:** Preserved periods in generated output names on Windows network shares instead of treating the final portion of the name as a file extension. Resolves [#61](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/61).
- **macOS Release Builds:** Moved Intel and Apple Silicon bundle jobs to the macOS 26 GitHub-hosted runners so release and validation workflows use the supported packaging environment.
- **Bundled FFmpeg Integrity:** Pinned FFmpeg and FFprobe to version `8.1.2` across macOS, Linux, and Windows, replaced mutable download URLs, and added SHA-256 verification for downloaded archives, extracted binaries, and cached runtime files.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Native GPUI Application:** Rebuilt Frame as a Rust-native GPUI-CE desktop app, replacing the previous Tauri/Svelte shell while keeping the main workspace, preview, settings, queue, and logs workflows in a single native application.
- **Rust Workspace Architecture:** Added dedicated `frame-app`, `frame-core`, and `frame-updater` crates so FFmpeg argument generation, media probing, compatibility rules, queue control, and update logic can be tested and shipped outside the UI layer.
- **Native Packaging Pipeline:** Added Rust-based release tooling, macOS/Linux/Windows bundle scripts, Linux desktop metadata, Windows resource embedding, and generated GitHub Actions workflows for building release artifacts.
- **Signed Update System:** Added a signed-manifest updater with platform-specific assets, SHA-256 verification, Ed25519 manifest signatures, install planning, and a bundled update helper for replacing installed builds.
- **GPUI Preview and Editing Surface:** Added a native preview panel with crop, transform, trim timeline, overlay controls, zoom handling, and FFmpeg-backed frame extraction for video, image, and audio workflows.
- **Native Settings and Metadata Panels:** Added GPUI settings surfaces for source details, output selection, video, audio, images, subtitles, metadata, and presets using the shared media compatibility model.
- **Image Encoding Controls:** Added format-specific still-image encoding controls for JPEG, WebP, PNG, and TIFF, including JPEG quality/Huffman mode, WebP lossy/lossless mode, quality/compression/presets, PNG compression/prediction, and TIFF compression selection with Rust-side validation and FFmpeg argument mapping.

### Changed

- **Application Runtime:** Moved the production app from a webview-based Tauri runtime to a native Rust/GPUI runtime, reducing the JavaScript frontend boundary and making Rust the primary application layer.
- **Conversion Flow:** Reworked import, queue, progress, cancellation, pause/resume, logging, and notification handling around native Rust state and process controllers while preserving FFmpeg-based conversion behavior.
- **Media Compatibility:** Centralized container, codec, stream, pixel-format, image, subtitle, and metadata rules in `frame-core` so UI option availability and conversion validation use the same Rust model.
- **Documentation:** Updated the project documentation around the GPUI-CE stack, Rust workspace layout, native packaging scripts, bundled FFmpeg runtime setup, and signed update manifest flow.

### Removed

- **Tauri/Svelte Application Shell:** Removed the previous `src-tauri` backend, SvelteKit frontend, Tauri capabilities/configuration, webview services, stores, components, routes, and JavaScript build toolchain.
- **Frontend Localization System:** Removed the previous Svelte-era locale dictionaries and i18n extraction/sync guardrail scripts.
- **Legacy Web Preview Pipeline:** Removed the Pixi/WebGPU web preview implementation in favor of the GPUI/FFmpeg-backed native preview implementation.
- **FFmpeg Log Syntax Highlighting:** Removed the previous web-based FFmpeg log syntax highlighting from the Logs view during the native GPUI rewrite.
- **ML Upscaling Runtime:** Removed the bundled RealESRGAN model assets and Tauri upscaling worker path from the production app.
- **Legacy App Icon Sets:** Removed unused Tauri mobile/store icon resources, keeping the desktop package icon set consumed by the native bundle scripts.

## [0.29.2] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- **Preview Image Loading:** Fixed image sources and image overlays in the Pixi preview by decoding local files through the Tauri filesystem API and `ImageBitmap`, avoiding stalled Pixi image loads and WebGPU cross-origin upload failures in dev and packaged builds.
- **Preview WebGPU Rendering:** Centralized Pixi preview imports through a local bootstrap module with the required WebGPU uniform upload compatibility patch, and isolated overlay rendering in its own render group to keep overlay controls rendering correctly.

## [0.29.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **Packaged Preview Renderer:** Fixed a black video preview in packaged builds by loading Pixi's CSP-safe unsafe-eval polyfills before initializing the preview renderer.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Pixi Preview Renderer:** Added a Pixi.js-backed preview renderer for video/image presentation, including WebGPU preference, explicit frame rendering for paused/seeked video frames, and HiDPI canvas density capped at `2x`.
- **Modular Preview Architecture:** Split the monolithic preview panel into focused preview components and Svelte controllers for rendering, playback, crop state, toolbar actions, and trim timeline handling.
- **Preview Canvas Navigation:** Added preview-only zoom and pan controls for video/image canvas inspection, including wheel zoom, drag panning, double-click reset, and a dedicated bottom-right zoom toolbar.
- **Preview Image Overlay:** Added image overlay controls for video previews, including PNG/JPG/WebP selection, drag positioning, corner resizing, opacity adjustment, replacement/removal actions, and localized toolbar labels.
- **Overlay Export Pipeline:** Added FFmpeg overlay composition for re-encoded video and image outputs, with validation for missing overlay files, stream-copy mode, audio-only outputs, and GIF output.
- **Trim Timeline Label Localization:** Added a localized trim timeline label across all supported UI dictionaries.

### Changed

- **Preview Timeline Layout:** Reworked trim controls into a compact minimal timeline paired with timecode inputs, including direct seek support, hover/current-time indicators, and disabled image-state handling.
- **Preview Crop/Transform Controls:** Moved rotation, flip, crop, crop-aspect, zoom, and overlay controls into localized icon toolbars around the preview surface while keeping preview transforms synchronized with persisted settings.
- **Preview Media Pipeline:** Switched video/image preview rendering from DOM media transforms to a Pixi canvas scene, while keeping audio preview on a hidden native audio element.
- **Overlay Bounds:** Clamped overlay scaling by the rendered source and target frame aspect ratios so oversized square/tall overlays stay inside widescreen video frames in both preview and export.
- **Preview Action Buttons:** Updated file-row, trim, crop, transform, and zoom actions to use shared button variants and tooltip treatment for more consistent preview/workspace controls.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Audio VBR Encoding (MP3/AAC):** Added Variable Bitrate mode to the Audio tab alongside the existing target-bitrate control, exposing a codec-aware quality slider that maps to `-q:a 0..9` for `libmp3lame` and `-vbr 1..5` for `libfdk_aac`, with per-codec clamping, copy-mode reset, and Rust-side validation. Resolves [#41](https://github.com/66HEX/frame/issues/41).
- **Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Option:** Added `libfdk_aac` as a selectable audio codec in the Audio tab when the bundled FFmpeg build exposes the encoder, and extended `mp4`/`m4a` container compatibility rules accordingly.
- **Audio Encoder Capability Detection:** Extended `get_available_encoders` and the frontend capabilities store to detect `libfdk_aac` and `libmp3lame` at runtime, gating VBR UI surfaces behind actual encoder availability.
- **Audio VBR Localization:** Added new audio bitrate-mode and quality-level locale keys (`qualityControl`, `targetBitrate`, `variableBitrate`, `qualityLevel`, `qualityBest`, `qualitySmallest`) across all nine supported UI dictionaries.

### Changed

- **Theme Token System:** Migrated the UI palette to OKLCH-based `frame-*` tokens, introduced a shared radius/shadow scale, and refreshed scrollbar + highlight styling for more consistent surfaces.
- **Primary Surfaces Refresh:** Updated preview, file list, settings panel, logs view, and update dialog styling to the new tokens (cards, borders, shadows, and typography).
- **Titlebars (macOS/Windows/Linux):** Refined separators, view-switch group styling, and metrics text to match the new theme.
- **File List Rows:** Improved checkbox alignment, hover/selected states, status color mapping, and action button styling.
- **Drag-and-Drop Import:** Restyled the import overlay into a full-surface dashed dropzone with safer padding on small windows.

### Removed

- **Bundled Font Weights:** Removed unused Loskeley Mono Regular/Medium/Bold/ExtraBold TTF assets, keeping the SemiBold face as the single embedded weight.
- **Unused Icon:** Removed the unused `IconFilm` component/export.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Subtitle Burn-In Style Controls:** Added subtitle styling options in the Subtitles tab for burned-in subtitles, including font family (system font list), font size, text color, outline color, and vertical position presets.
- **Subtitle Style UI Primitives:** Added reusable `Select` and `ColorPicker` UI components (plus chevrons up/down icon) to support compact dropdown and color selection workflows in settings panels.

### Changed

- **Subtitle Filter Mapping (FFmpeg):** Extended conversion config and ffmpeg subtitle filter building to map subtitle style selections into `force_style` (font name/size, primary color, outline color, and alignment), including safe hex-to-ASS color conversion and coverage tests.
- **Surface/Control Visual Consistency:** Unified card/input/button highlight styling and related control spacing across preview, file list, logs, update dialog, and workspace shells for more consistent panel rendering.
- **Subtitle Styling Localization:** Added new subtitle style locale keys across all supported UI dictionaries for the new styling controls and hints.

### Fixed

- **Trim Timeline Edge Alignment:** Fixed preview timeline marker alignment so the current-time playhead and trim handles share the same center point and stay visually aligned at boundary values (`0%`/`100%`).

## [0.26.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- **Image Workflow (End-to-End):** Added first-class image source handling across probing (`mediaKind=image`), settings navigation (new `Images` tab), file-picker filters, and locale dictionaries.
- **Image Output Compatibility Rules:** Extended shared frontend/backend media rules with dedicated image containers/codecs (`png`, `jpg`, `webp`, `bmp`, `tiff`) and aligned container capability checks.
- **Image Controls Parity:** Added image-side settings for resolution/scaling, ML upscaling selection, and pixel format selection using the same compatibility-driven option model as video.

### Changed

- **Native Dialog + Window Surface Simplification:** Removed custom Rust dialog commands and the macOS `dialog-host` workaround in favor of direct `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog` usage on the frontend. Also removed window effects/transparency plumbing (window tint setting, opacity store hydration, and opacity-driven background mixing), keeping the app on standard opaque window surfaces.
- **Crop Overlay Visual Overhaul:** Reworked the preview crop overlay presentation with stronger contrast, improved frame styling, clearer rule-of-thirds guides, refined corner marks, and larger/more readable drag handles for a more professional editor-like feel.
- **Fixed App Typography Mode:** Removed runtime font-family switching and locked UI typography to the embedded Loskeley Mono stack for consistent visuals across sessions/platforms.
- **Primary View Rename (`Dashboard` → `Workspace`):** Renamed the main app view identifier/labels across page state, titlebar controls, and locale dictionaries; synced non-source locales to the new `titlebar.workspace` key and applied translated values.
- **Image-Aware UI Semantics:** Source metadata now uses image-specific labels/fields for image inputs (instead of video stream semantics), hides empty non-applicable metrics, and limits metadata editing fields to image-relevant tags.
- **Image Preview Interaction Model:** Preview now renders images as still media, disables trim timeline/timecode interactions for image inputs, and keeps transform/crop tooling available.
- **Image Output Normalization:** Config normalization and presets/output selection now enforce image-safe behavior (re-encode only, image-capable containers, no audio/subtitle carryover).

### Fixed

- **Startup Window Handshake (No Splash):** Removed the dedicated splash window flow and switched startup to show the main window only after initialization completes in the frontend boot sequence (`finally`-guarded), preventing stuck-splash states on packaged Windows installs while still avoiding hidden-window deadlocks when a startup step fails.
- **Crop Overlay Scaling + Layering:** Moved crop overlay rendering outside the transformed video layer so handles/guides keep consistent on-screen size and no longer collapse to subpixel widths. Also raised the crop aspect-ratio action bar above overlay layers to prevent it from being visually covered during crop mode.
- **Settings Panel Scope:** Removed the App Settings `Visuals` section and deprecated font-family controls to match the mono-only typography model.
- **Cancellation Event Semantics:** Conversion manager now emits a dedicated `conversion-cancelled` event instead of `conversion-error` when a task was intentionally canceled, preventing false error dialogs and restoring clean cancellation flow in the queue UI.
- **Process Identity Guarding:** Task control operations (`pause`/`resume`/`cancel`) now verify the active process identity using PID + process start-time metadata, reducing the risk of signaling a different process when PIDs are reused by the OS.
- **Manager Runtime Coverage:** Added targeted unit tests for conversion-manager state cleanup and process-identity validation paths, increasing automated coverage of cancel/error/pause-resume critical runtime behavior.
- **Extended Clippy Quality Pass:** Applied a broad pedantic/nursery/perf cleanup in Rust backend modules (queue manager, args/upscale/worker pipelines, dialog/capabilities, core bootstrap), preserving `clippy -D warnings` and reducing extended-clippy findings from ~173 to ~52 warnings.
- **Extended Clippy Follow-up (Queue/Probe/Rules):** Refined conversion manager task-tracking internals (`HashSet` for running IDs), hardened Unix PID conversions, simplified media-rule lookups, and optimized probe metadata assignment paths; kept `cargo test --locked` and `clippy -D warnings` green while reducing extended-clippy findings from ~52 to ~22 warnings.
- **Extended Clippy Completion (Pedantic/Nursery/Perf):** Finalized remaining extended-clippy items across conversion pipeline and tests (numeric conversion safety, assertion/message cleanup, extension checks, unnecessary collection removal, and documented intentional architectural lint expectations), bringing `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -W clippy::pedantic -W clippy::nursery -W clippy::perf` to 0 warnings.
- **Encoder-Aware Pixel Format Compatibility:** Reworked pixel format validation from container-only rules to shared `container+encoder` compatibility tables in `media-rules.json`, wired into both frontend normalization/UI option availability and Rust backend preflight validation. This prevents invalid combinations from being selectable/enqueued and avoids silent runtime pixel format downgrades in common hardware/software encoder paths.
- **Single-Image FFmpeg Output Path:** Added explicit single-frame output flags in standard and upscale encode paths for image containers, preventing ffmpeg image-sequence pattern errors on standalone image export.
- **Image Metadata Classification Noise:** Improved ffprobe mapping for images by classifying still-image inputs and clearing non-applicable duration/FPS/bitrate fields to avoid misleading values in UI and logs.

## [0.25.3] - 2026-03-02

### Removed

- Reverted accidentally public experimental UI; purged unintended commits from history to restore the stable state.

## [0.25.2] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Linux AppImage Media Runtime:** Enabled AppImage media framework bundling (`bundleMediaFramework`) in Tauri config to avoid host/plugin version mismatches that could break WebKit/GStreamer playback pipelines on some distributions.
- **Linux Release Build Inputs:** Added GStreamer plugin packages (`base`, `good`, `bad`, `libav`) to the Linux publish workflow so AppImage bundling captures a complete, matching media runtime during CI builds.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Linux Native Dialog Theme (KDE/Portal):** Switched Linux dialog backend from GTK3 to XDG Desktop Portal so file/message dialogs follow desktop portal integration and better match system theme behavior (including KDE setups).

## [0.25.0] - 2026-02-15

### Changed

- **Typography System Rework:** Replaced embedded Geist fonts with Archivo + Loskeley Mono, rewired app font tokens/switching (`mono`/`sans`), and normalized typography across UI components (size/weight/letter-spacing) for more consistent readability. Updated all localized README files to reflect the new font stack.
- **Two-Tone Borders and Separators:** Replaced single-tone divider/border treatments with a two-tone background + subtle shadow style to better match the neumorphic UI direction.
- **Cursor Style Cleanup:** Removed redundant `cursor-*` utility classes from non-actionable/neutral surfaces (settings overlay, preview container layers, file rows, checkbox, slider) to keep cursor behavior visually consistent with element semantics.
- **Action Tooltips (Preview/List/Presets):** Replaced native `title` attributes with shared tooltip UI for preview transform controls, file row action controls, and preset action buttons for consistent hover labels.
- **Tooltip Layering and Positioning:** Updated shared tooltip rendering to use a body portal with viewport-aware fixed positioning, so labels are not clipped by parent overflow and stay visually centered.
- **Common Action Copy:** Added shared i18n keys `common.pause` and `common.resume` and applied translated values across all supported locales.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-02-14

### Changed

- **Neumorphic Highlight Layering:** Reworked shared `.card-highlight`, `.input-highlight`, and `.button-highlight` styles to use isolated `::before` overlay layers for more consistent inner-highlight rendering.
- **Ghost Button Border Cleanup:** Removed redundant transparent borders from ghost buttons and icon tab/aspect controls to simplify control outlines and spacing.
- **Selection Indicator Polish:** Updated audio/subtitle track selectors and checkbox surfaces to follow current window opacity and use a clearer active-state marker color.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **DeepL Translation Automation:** Added `i18n-translate` tooling to translate locale keys from `en-US` via DeepL with header-based authentication, placeholder preservation, retry handling, and parser-error fallback behavior.
- **Reusable Tooltip Component:** Added `ui/Tooltip.svelte` with configurable side variants via `class-variance-authority`, arrow rendering, Svelte transition animation, and delayed-first-hover behavior with instant trigger-to-trigger switching.
- **Stream Copy / Remux Mode:** Added a new `Cut / Stream Copy` processing mode for trim + remux workflows without re-encoding (`-c copy`), including queue/config support across frontend and backend.

### Changed

- **Neumorphic UI Redesign:** Reworked the app shell and core UI controls in a neumorphic style across dashboard/settings/logs/titlebars, including updated surface tokens (`background`/`sidebar`) and new shared highlight treatments for cards, buttons, and inputs.
- **Translation Workflow Commands:** Added `i18n:translate`, `i18n:translate:write`, `i18n:translate:rewrite`, and `i18n:sync:auto` scripts plus updated contributor workflow documentation.
- **Non-English Locale Consistency:** Re-translated all non-source locale files from the current `en-US` dictionary baseline to reduce cross-locale copy drift.
- **App Settings Language Hover UI:** Replaced inline CSS hover labels in language selection with the shared tooltip component for consistent interaction behavior.
- **Shared Media Rules (Copy Validation):** Extended `media-rules.json` with stream-level container compatibility tables (video/audio/subtitle) and applied them in both UI container availability and backend preflight validation for stream copy tasks.

### Fixed

- **Input Placeholder Contrast:** Increased placeholder/readability contrast in shared text and timecode inputs and aligned subtitle burn file picker text to foreground color for better visibility.

## [0.23.2] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **i18n Production Startup Regression:** Restored eager locale module loading and registered dictionaries from the preloaded module map to prevent release builds from stalling on splash.
- **i18n Build Noise:** Removed mixed eager/dynamic locale import behavior that triggered repeated Vite chunking warnings during production builds.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **i18n Guardrails Tooling:** Added `i18n:extract`, `i18n:check`, and `i18n:sync` scripts with `en-US` as source-of-truth, locale key diff checks, placeholder parity validation, and optional sync autofill for missing translations.
- **CI Locale Validation:** Added a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow that runs i18n guardrail checks on pull requests and pushes.

### Fixed

- **Conversion Failure Dialog Regression:** Restored native error dialog display for failed conversions with localized title and close action label.
- **Source Metadata Coverage:** Added missing Source tab rendering for `colorPrimaries` metadata returned by ffprobe probing.
- **Stale Locale Key Cleanup:** Removed unused i18n keys across all locale files after UI scope verification (keeping `common.*` keys intentionally reusable).
- **File List Action Hover Drift:** Replaced the row bottom separator from `border-b` to an `::after` 1px line to eliminate subpixel vertical drift when action buttons appear on hover.
- **ML Upscale Sidecar Permission:** Added missing Tauri shell capability for `realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan` so runtime encoder detection and AI upscaling execution can start the sidecar successfully.
- **Update Dialog HTML Safety:** Escaped release note HTML before Markdown rendering in the in-app updater dialog to prevent rendering untrusted raw HTML from update metadata.
- **Manual Update Check Recovery:** Hardened the settings-side update check flow so request failures no longer leave the UI stuck in a perpetual "Checking..." state.
- **Startup Panic Guarding:** Replaced panic-prone window unwraps in the Tauri bootstrap and splash-close flow with explicit error handling to reduce fatal crashes during window lifecycle edge cases.
- **i18n Build Warnings:** Removed duplicate locale eager/dynamic import pattern in the i18n bootstrap, eliminating repeated Vite chunking warnings during production builds.
- **Capability Surface Hardening:** Removed unused global `fs:allow-read-file` capability grant to reduce default filesystem exposure.
- **Rust Lint Compliance:** Applied `cargo clippy` recommendations across conversion, dialog, and window lifecycle modules, including enum size reduction, conditional simplifications, and minor API usage cleanups to keep `clippy -D warnings` green.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **GIF Workflow:** Added full GIF output support across frontend and backend, including container selection, dedicated GIF settings UI (palette colors, dither mode, loop count), strict compatibility normalization, backend validation, and FFmpeg palette pipeline generation.
- **GIF Presets:** Added built-in GIF-focused presets for web-friendly and higher-quality export scenarios.

### Changed

- **Shared Media Rules (FE/BE):** Container, audio-only, and codec-compatibility rules now come from a single shared `media-rules.json` source consumed by both frontend and backend validation paths, removing duplicated rule definitions.
- **Multilingual Docs & Locales:** Updated all localized READMEs and UI locale files to include GIF container support and GIF settings copy in each supported language.

### Fixed

- **Compatibility Drift Risk:** Eliminated a class of frontend/backend mismatches where UI-allowed configurations could diverge from Rust-side input validation due to duplicated hardcoded rule tables.
- **GIF Stream Mapping:** Corrected GIF conversion mapping to emit a single filtered video stream (`[gif_out]`), preventing muxer failures caused by multi-stream video output.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **AI Upscaling Setup:** Updated documentation across all supported languages to guide users through Real-ESRGAN asset installation.
- **Upscaling Capability Detection:** The app now automatically detects the presence of the `realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan` sidecar and required ML models, gating UI controls accordingly.

### Performance

- **Upscale Thread Tuning:** The ML upscaling pipeline now dynamically tunes `realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan` thread counts (`load:proc:save`) based on source resolution, scale factor, and available CPU cores instead of using a fixed `4:4:4` configuration. This prevents VRAM exhaustion on lower-end GPUs while allowing higher concurrency on smaller inputs.

### Fixed

- **VideoToolbox Selection Freeze:** Resolved an infinite reactive loop in the settings panel triggered by selecting VideoToolbox encoders, which were incorrectly reporting all encoding presets as invalid.
- **Upscaling Duration and Gaps:** Forced Constant Frame Rate (CFR) and synchronization during frame extraction to prevent duration drift and sequence gaps (static images) in AI-upscaled videos.
- **Upscaling Pixel Format:** Restored pixel format preservation in the AI upscaling pipeline, ensuring output matches source bit-depth (e.g., 10-bit) or defaults to compatible yuv420p.
- **AI Upscale Progress:** Improved progress accuracy by driving updates from per-frame completion logs and hardening calculations for videos where total frame counts cannot be pre-determined.
- **Upscaler Preflight:** Resolved an issue where the AI upscaler preflight check would fail on some systems due to non-zero exit codes during help-text verification.
- **Log Highlighting (CSP):** Updated Content Security Policy to allow inline styles, fixing Shiki-based runtime log highlighting in production builds.
- **Upscale Mode Validation:** Added strict backend validation for ML upscale modes to prevent invalid configurations from entering the processing queue.
- **ML Control Reactivity:** Fixed a UI bug where ML upscale buttons remained enabled even if runtime dependencies were missing.

## [0.21.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **Runtime Log Highlighting Dependencies:** Moved `shiki` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` and added direct runtime dependency on `@shikijs/themes`, so packaged builds include required log-highlighting modules.
- **Output Name Path Safety:** Hardened output name handling on both frontend and backend so custom names cannot escape the source directory via absolute paths or traversal segments.
- **Error Event Duplication:** Removed duplicate `conversion-error` emission from the worker path so failures are reported once through manager flow.
- **Settings Persistence Race:** Prevented settings write-back before initial hydration completes, fixing startup-time overwrites of saved preferences.
- **Subtitle Burn Path Escaping:** Expanded FFmpeg subtitle filter escaping for special characters (including quotes and bracket/comma tokens) to avoid burn-in command breakage on valid file paths.
- **Localization Consistency:** Replaced remaining hardcoded UI strings in logs/source panels with i18n keys and synced locale dictionaries.
- **Concurrency Limit Reactivity:** Applying a new max concurrency value now immediately re-processes the queue so pending tasks can start without waiting for another queue event.
- **Trim Range Validation:** Task validation now rejects non-increasing trim ranges (`end_time <= start_time`) and malformed trim timestamps before enqueue.
- **Output Extension Consistency:** Custom output names now always end with the selected container extension, preventing mismatches between UI container choice and written file suffix.
- **Dialog Directory Scope:** Folder picker permission scopes now respect the `recursive` flag when granting Tauri directory access, avoiding unintentionally broad directory grants.
- **Native Dialog Kind Contract:** Backend dialog kind parsing now explicitly accepts `question`, matching the frontend `askNativeDialog` type contract.
- **ML Upscale FPS Timeline:** Upscale re-encode now always reads extracted PNG frames at source FPS, while optional target FPS conversion is applied only on output (`-r`), preventing unintended playback speed changes.
- **ML Upscale Metadata Preserve:** In upscale mode, `metadata.mode = preserve` now maps metadata from the original source input (`-map_metadata 1`) so source tags are retained as expected.
- **ML Upscale Argument Regression Tests:** Added focused unit tests for upscale encode argument building (source FPS input timing and metadata mode behavior) to catch future pipeline regressions.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Windows ML Upscaling Paths:** Normalized extended-length Windows paths (`\\?\...`) before passing frame and model directories to the Real-ESRGAN sidecar, fixing `_wfopen ... failed` errors during upscaling.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Queue Cancellation Semantics:** Canceling a queued conversion now prevents it from starting later in the background. Queue state now tracks canceled IDs, avoids duplicate task IDs, and removes canceled items before worker launch.
- **Process Signal Safety:** Pause/resume/cancel controls now ignore invalid PID `0` placeholders, preventing unsafe Unix signal targeting. ML upscale startup no longer publishes a fake PID, and unexpected encoder shutdowns now return an explicit worker error instead of reporting silent success.
- **FFmpeg Stream Mapping:** Standard conversions now always map streams deterministically (`0:v:0`, `0:a?`, `0:s?`) when track overrides are not selected, eliminating ambiguous defaults and missing-stream edge cases.
- **Audio Config Application:** Audio codec and bitrate settings are now applied consistently even when no explicit source audio tracks are selected.
- **Cross-Tab Config Consistency:** Configuration normalization now runs in the shared state layer (including preset application), so container/codec/preset/upscale compatibility is enforced even if the Video tab was never opened.
- **Compatibility Rule Unification:** Video container/codec/preset compatibility now comes from a shared frontend module used by both UI selection logic and config normalization, preventing drift between tab behavior and saved state validation.
- **Input Validation Hardening:** Backend validation now rejects incompatible codec/container combinations and blocks ML upscaling with audio-only outputs before task enqueue.
- **Subtitle Container Handling:** Subtitle stream behavior is now container-aware (`mov_text` for MP4/MOV, `webvtt` for WebM, `copy` for MKV) and no longer auto-maps subtitle tracks when only burn-in subtitles are requested.
- **Queue Startup Recovery:** Conversion queue startup now handles per-file enqueue failures gracefully, marking only failed items as errors while continuing with valid tasks and keeping processing state in sync.
- **Timecode Input UX:** Trim timecode fields now support pasting valid values (`HH:MM:SS.mmm`, `MM:SS`, or seconds), reducing manual editing friction.
- **Lint Stability:** Added a scoped ESLint override for Shiki-rendered log HTML in `LogsView`, resolving the `svelte/no-at-html-tags` lint failure for trusted, syntax-highlighted output.
- **Queue Logic:** Resolved an issue where completed files would be re-queued for conversion when restarting the batch. The queue now explicitly ignores files with a "Completed" status.
- **Titlebar UX:** The "Start Conversion" button is now disabled when all selected files have already been successfully processed, providing better visual feedback and preventing accidental re-runs.

### Added

- **Hardware Decoding Support:** Integrated GPU-accelerated video decoding for input files using NVIDIA CUDA and Apple VideoToolbox. This reduces CPU load and improves conversion speed by offloading the decoding phase to the hardware.
- **Log Syntax Highlighting:** Integrated Shiki highlighting engine into `LogsView` for improved readability of FFmpeg output.
- **Custom Log Language:** Developed a comprehensive TextMate grammar for FFmpeg logs, featuring specialized highlighting for codecs, timestamps, file paths, CPU capabilities, and conversion phases (DECODE/ENCODE/UPSCALE).

### Changed

- **Settings Accessibility:** Users can now switch between all configuration tabs (Source, Output, Video, etc.) even after a file has been converted, while maintaining the locked state of individual settings.
- **Store Convention Consistency:** `updateStore` now uses the same object-based `$state` pattern as other frontend stores, reducing architectural divergence in shared state management.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Codec-Container Compatibility:** Video encoders are now automatically filtered and disabled based on the selected output container (e.g., WebM only shows VP9/AV1 codecs). Incompatible encoders display an "Incompatible container" message and switch to a compatible codec automatically.

### Changed

- **Backend Refactoring:** Split monolithic `ffmpeg.rs` (1048 lines) into focused modules: `utils.rs`, `args.rs`, `upscale.rs`, `worker.rs`. Improves maintainability without changing functionality.

### Fixed

- **MKV Metadata Parsing:** Fixed metadata tags (Artist, Album, Genre, Date, Comment) not being read from MKV files. The parser now correctly handles both uppercase (MKV) and lowercase (MP4) tag variants.
- **Progress Display:** Resolved an issue where the UI would remain stuck on "Queued" status during the ML upscaling decode phase. A new `conversion-started` event now immediately updates the status to "Converting" when processing begins.
- **Windows Progress Indicator:** Fixed progress percentage not updating for h264 and h264_nvenc codecs on Windows. The FFmpeg stderr parser now correctly handles Windows-style carriage return (`\r`) line separators.
- **ML Upscale Parameter Parity:** The AI upscaling pipeline now supports all parameters from the standard conversion: rotation, flip, subtitle burn, FPS change, NVENC/VideoToolbox options, audio processing (codec, bitrate, volume, normalize, channels), metadata handling, and subtitle track selection.
- **ML Upscale Temp Cleanup:** Temporary PNG frame files are now properly deleted when an upscaling task fails or is cancelled from the UI.
- **Progress Reporting:** Fixed an issue where progress would remain at 0% for some files due to strict time parsing. The parser now correctly handles FFmpeg output with raw seconds or flexible time formats.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **AI Upscaling:** Integrated AI-powered video upscaling using Real-ESRGAN models (x2, x4) for high-quality resolution enhancement.
- **Features Architecture:** Introduced a new modular architecture in `src/lib/features/` to separate business logic from UI components.
  - `conversion`: Logic for queue management, presets, and conversion progress.
  - `files`: Logic for file list management and drag-and-drop operations.
  - `update`: Logic for app update checks and installation.
- **Component Reorganization:** Improved project structure by organizing components into logical subdirectories (`file-list`, `layout`, `logs`).
- **Unified Exports:** Implemented index files for feature modules and component groups to simplify imports and improve maintainability.

### Performance

- **Log Virtualization:** Implemented a virtualized list for the application logs, enabling smooth scrolling and rendering of thousands of entries without UI lag.

### Fixed

- **Video Trimming:** Resolved an issue where trimming a segment from the middle of a video would ignore the end point. The logic now uses a calculated duration (`-t`) instead of an absolute end time (`-to`) when a start offset is present.
- **Progress Reporting:** Fixed inaccurate progress bars during trimmed conversions. Progress is now correctly calculated relative to the trimmed segment length rather than the full source duration.

### Fixed

- **Process Lifecycle:** Resolved a "zombie process" issue on macOS where the application would remain running in the dock after closing the main window, due to hidden helper windows keeps the event loop alive.
- **UI Contrast:** Fixed text contrast in `LogsView` to improve readability.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- **Native Dialogs:** Implemented a unified `askNativeDialog` system for cross-platform confirmation messages. Includes specialized macOS support via a hidden `always_on_top` helper window to ensure dialogs stay above the main HUD window without breaking visual effects or passing clicks to background applications.
- **Visual Feedback:** Added a global background overlay with backdrop blur that automatically activates whenever a native file or message dialog is open, blocking interactions with the main window while the dialog is active.
- **Error Reporting:** Conversion failures (e.g., hardware encoder issues) now display a native error dialog with the failure reason instead of silently failing. Error messages are also logged to the conversion log panel.

### Changed

- **Code Architecture:** Refactored the monolithic `conversion.rs` (1712 lines) into a modular structure with dedicated files for types, error handling, manager logic, FFmpeg argument building, media probing, and Tauri commands. Improves maintainability without changing public API.
- **Styling:** Cleaned up `src/routes/layout.css` by removing unused CSS classes and optimizing the global stylesheet.

### Fixed

- **Preview Panel:** Trim slider and timecode inputs are now disabled after conversion completes, preventing pointless edits to already-processed files.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **AV1 Hardware Acceleration:** Added support for NVIDIA's AV1 hardware encoder (`av1_nvenc`) for compatible RTX 40-series GPUs. Integrated with the existing quality slider for consistent VBR control.
- **Hardware Encoder Controls:** The video panel now exposes NVENC-specific AQ toggles (spatial and temporal) and a software-fallback switch for VideoToolbox, mirroring the new ffmpeg flag support.

### Changed

- **Preset Awareness:** Hardware encoders now only show presets they actually accept, and NVENC selections are automatically mapped to valid ffmpeg preset names to prevent failed launches with legacy user presets.
- **FFmpeg Argument Builder:** Updated to emit the correct hardware flags (`-cq:v`/AQ options for NVENC, `-allow_sw` for VideoToolbox) and to skip unsupported parameters like `-preset` for VideoToolbox, ensuring conversions no longer fail when switching between software and hardware encoders.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **Preview Panel:** Enhanced the video playback overlay with interactive behavior.
  - **Dynamic Overlay:** The play/pause overlay now automatically appears on hover during playback and remains visible when paused.
  - **Animated Transitions:** Implemented smooth Svelte fade transitions for the overlay and playback controls.
  - **Contextual Icons:** The overlay button now dynamically toggles between Play and Pause icons based on the current playback state.

### Fixed

- **Preview Panel:** Resolved a frame flickering issue where the video would jump back to the start frame while adjusting the trim handles. The playback loop logic is now suppressed during active dragging to ensure a smooth frame preview.

### Changed

- **Icon System:** Migrated the entire application icon set from `lucide-svelte` to Phosphor Icons.
- **Icon Architecture:** Implemented a central icon management system in `src/lib/icons` using a standardized "internal naming" convention (e.g., `IconPlay`, `IconTrash`, `IconClose`). This decouples UI components from specific libraries and simplifies future icon set swaps.
- **Performance:** Converted all raw SVG icons into native Svelte 5 components with support for reactive `size` and `class` properties.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Windows Titlebar:** Introduced a dedicated titlebar component for Windows, replacing the previously shared Linux titlebar. This provides a more native look and feel on Windows systems.
- **Dynamic Font Switching:** Added the ability to toggle between Geist Mono and Geist Sans fonts across the entire application.
  - **New Visual Setting:** Added a font family selector in the App Settings under the Visuals section.
  - **Persistence:** The chosen font preference is saved and automatically applied on subsequent launches.
- **Subtitle Support:** Comprehensive handling of subtitle tracks within the application.
  - **Soft-subs:** Added ability to select and passthrough existing subtitle tracks from the source file. By default, all tracks are preserved if none are explicitly selected.
  - **Hard-subs (Burn-in):** Support for burning in external subtitle files (`.srt`, `.ass`, `.vtt`) directly into the video stream. The process includes automatic path escaping for cross-platform compatibility.

### Changed

- **UI:** Replaced text-based setting tabs with intuitive icon-based buttons (Source, Output, Video, Audio, Metadata, Presets) for a cleaner and more compact interface.
- **Documentation:** Updated README with Linux system requirements for AppImage users.

### Fixed

- **macOS Dialog Reparenting:** Native file dialogs are now spawned from an invisible helper window so the main HUD window keeps its rounded corners while the picker is open, eliminating the rectangular flash that previously appeared when the dialog borrowed the app window.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Smart Scaling (Letterbox/Pillarbox):** Implemented intelligent scaling for custom resolutions. When both width and height are specified (e.g., in 4K or Social presets), the application now maintains the original aspect ratio by adding black bars (padding) instead of stretching the video.
- **Social Media Presets:** Added 6 new built-in presets for YouTube (1080p, 4K), X (Landscape, Portrait), TikTok/Reels, and Discord, optimized according to 2025 platform recommendations.
- **HEVC Hardware Acceleration:** Added support for H.265 (HEVC) hardware encoding via `hevc_videotoolbox` (Apple Silicon/Intel) and `hevc_nvenc` (NVIDIA).
- **Smart Encoder Detection:** The application now dynamically scans `ffmpeg` capabilities at startup to only show encoders supported by the user's hardware (e.g., hiding NVENC on macOS or VideoToolbox on Windows), replacing the previous static OS-based filtering.

### Changed

- **Code Architecture:** Refactored the Interactive Crop Tool logic into a dedicated utility module (`crop.ts`), improving maintainability and component readability.

### Fixed

- **Preset Matching:** Improved the logic for identifying the "Applied" preset in the UI by including video bitrate, custom resolution dimensions, and bitrate mode in the comparison, resolving an issue where multiple presets would appear as selected simultaneously.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Batch Preset Application:** Added a new "Apply to All" button in the Presets tab. This allows users to instantly apply a selected preset to all pending files in the queue after a confirmation dialog, significantly speeding up batch configuration workflows.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed

- **CI/CD:** Switched the Linux AMD64 build runner to `ubuntu-24.04` and pinned specific WebKitGTK versions to resolve `EGL_BAD_PARAMETER` errors when running the AppImage on modern Linux distributions like Arch/CachyOS.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Interactive Crop Tool:** A powerful new tool for cropping videos directly in the preview panel.
  - **Visual Composition:** Includes a draggable area with a rule-of-thirds (3x3) grid overlay and various aspect ratio presets (Free, 1:1, 16:9, etc.).
  - **Auto-Zoom:** Automatically zooms and centers the preview on the cropped area after application to ensure pixel-perfect inspection.
  - **Robust Transformations:** Fully integrates with rotation and flip controls. The crop coordinates automatically adapt to video orientation changes, and interaction handles remain intuitive (mouse direction matches visual movement) even when the video is rotated or mirrored.

### Changed

- **Dashboard layout:** Split the left column into a 12-row grid so the trim preview card permanently occupies the top section while the file list sits below it. This removes the floating trim modal and gives the timeline controls dedicated real estate.
- **Trim workflow:** The trimming card now applies start/end changes immediately (no Save/Cancel buttons) and is always visible with the selected file, providing constant video preview and faster adjustments without opening overlays.
- **Transform controls:** Rotation and flip moved out of the Video tab and into the preview card as icon-only buttons, with rotation cycling through 0/90/180/270° on each click for quicker access while adjusting trims.
- **Localization:** Linux titlebar buttons now use the same translated strings as the macOS variant (no more hard-coded English labels).

  - **Visual Timeline:** Draggable handles for setting start and end points with a real-time video preview.
  - **Timecode Precision:** Dedicated `TimecodeInput` component for millisecond-accurate manual entry.
  - **Live Preview:** Instant seek to start/end points and looped playback of the selected range.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **Task Cancellation:** Safely cancel active or paused tasks by removing them from the list (active tasks must be paused first to prevent accidental cancellation). This ensures that background FFmpeg processes are correctly terminated and queue slots are freed.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **Task Control:** Added ability to pause and resume active conversion tasks directly from the file list. Supported on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **Notifications:** Added native system notifications that trigger when a conversion queue finishes processing, summarizing the results (successes and errors).

### Fixed

- **CI/CD:** Removed deprecated `depends_on macos` directive from the Homebrew Cask generation workflow to resolve `brew doctor` warnings.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **Smart UI Adaptation:** The interface now automatically adapts when an audio file is selected:
  - **Tab Management:** The "Video" tab is automatically disabled.
  - **Container Filtering:** Video containers (MP4, MKV, etc.) are disabled in the output settings to prevent invalid configurations.
  - **Preset Filtering:** Incompatible video presets are visually disabled in the presets library.
- **Auto-Format Switching:** Importing an audio-only file automatically switches the output configuration to a compatible audio format (e.g., MP3) if a video container was previously selected.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- **Internationalization:** Multi-language interface with automatic system language detection. Supported languages: English, 简体中文, 日本語, 한국어, Español, Русский, Français, Deutsch, Italiano.
- **Documentation:** Added localized README files for all supported languages.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-26

- **Developer Experience:** Added `bun run setup:ffmpeg` to pull platform-specific FFmpeg/FFprobe binaries into `src-tauri/binaries`, mirroring the CI release workflow.

### Changed

- **UX:** Changing the output container now automatically switches the audio codec to a compatible default (e.g., selecting FLAC container auto-selects FLAC codec), preventing invalid configurations.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-01-25

### Changed

- **Window Effects:** Dropped the `window_vibrancy` crate in favor of Tauri's built-in `WindowEffect` / `EffectsBuilder`, keeping the same Acrylic / HudWindow visuals while relying on the maintained `tauri_utils` surface.
- **UI:** Removed the global `border-radius` on the HTML root since rounded corners are handled elsewhere.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- **UI:** Added a "Window Tint" slider in App Settings that lets you control the background opacity (20‑100%), persists the choice, and applies it immediately across the app window.

### Changed

- **Windows UI:** Switched the desktop effect from Mica to Acrylic for both the main window and splash screen to better reflect the adjustable tint and improve consistency with system styling.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- **Auto-Update:** Added a user preference to enable or disable automatic update checks on startup. This can be toggled via a new checkbox in the App Updates section of the settings.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- **UI:** Added a custom settings sheet and implemented animations for all overlays.
- **Auto-Update:** Added Markdown parsing and text styling for release notes in the update dialog.

## [0.2.0-beta.4] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- **Hardware Acceleration UX:** Added a dedicated quality slider (1-100) for Hardware Encoders (VideoToolbox, NVENC) which now correctly maps to native quality flags (`-q:v`, `-cq:v`) instead of CRF.
- **Smart Codec Filtering:** The application now intelligently hides hardware codecs not supported by the user's operating system (e.g., hiding NVENC on macOS).

### Removed

- **Estimation:** Removed the estimated output size panel to prioritize UI simplicity.

### Changed

- **UI:** Updated scrollbar styling to better integrate with the application theme.

### Added

- **macOS Intel support:** Added builds and binaries for x86_64 Mac architecture.
- **Smart scrolling:** Implemented automatic scrolling in the logs view.
- **Global Settings:** New "App" tab in settings for global configuration.
- **Conversion Safety:** Disable the remove button for files currently being converted to prevent errors.

### Changed

- **Estimation Algorithm:** Refactored and fine-tuned the file size estimation logic for better accuracy.
- **UI Consistency:** Standardized title bar button sizes across all platforms.
- **UI Cleanup:** General cleanup and refinement of UI components.
- **Platform Compatibility:** Gated vibrancy imports to improve stability across different OS.

### Fixed
